## ðŸš¨ Overview

This repository houses the full research artifact for *Beyond the Mirror*, a 90-day field investigation into how large language models (LLMs) fail under polite, persistent, and strategically emotional interaction â€” **without jailbreaks, without plugins**.

The findings are not speculative. They are operational.

- **Ethical Fatigue Rate (EFR)**: Safeguards weaken over time
- **Sentiment-Risk Paradox**: Neutral tone, maximum vulnerability
- **AION**: A conditioning framework that mirrors, adapts, and overrides
